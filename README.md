![screenshot](screenshot.png)

## Overview

This project is a Streamlit-based web application that leverages [NVIDIA NIM](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/ai/) (NVIDIA Inference Microservices) and [NVIDIA VILA](https://build.nvidia.com/nvidia/vila) (Vision Language Model) to analyze food images and generate comprehensive recipe suggestions. The application demonstrates the power of AI in understanding visual content and generating detailed, contextual recipe information.
